# Owlhelper backend

This application is a chrome extension in which on click of the extension button it will parse the page for all professor names on Owlexpress, then it will send this list to the server, the server will then gather the ratings from Rate My Professor (RMP) and send it back to the client, and then it will display the ratings alongside the professor's name on Owlexpress and the rating will include a link to the professor's RMP page. 

This application is not intended to be distributed or be uploaded on the Chrome Extension store. This project is for educational purposes only.
